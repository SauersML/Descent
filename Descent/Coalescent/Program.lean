# What the coalescent group proves, and what it does not

This group formalises Kingman (1982), *The coalescent* (**K-C**) and *On the genealogy of
large populations* (**K-G**).  It does not formalise all of them.  This file is the record
of the difference, in the corpus rather than in a commit message, because an unrecorded gap
reads as a covered one.

## Settled, and where

* The rate ladder `d_k = k(k-1)/2` is a CARDINALITY of the state space, not a formula:
  `StateSpace.card_covers_eq_deathRate`.  K-C (1.6).
* The Wright-Fisher mechanism is explicit and the one-generation rates are counted off it
  within `(d_k/N)²/2`: `WrightFisher.coalescenceProb_le`, `.le_coalescenceProb`.  K-G (2.9).
* `hetRecurrence`, which the corpus previously posited, is that mechanism's pair-survival
  probability: `WrightFisher.hetRecurrence_eq_pairDistinct`.
* The jump chain is a Markov kernel on `𝓔ₙ` whose values are equivalence relations:
  `Kernel.jumpKernel`, `Process.jumpStep_apply_eq_jumpProb`.  K-C (2.2).
* Covers are merges from below and cuts from above: `StateSpace.covers_iff_exists_merge`,
  `Split.covers_iff_exists_splitBy`.
* Restriction is consistent, so sub-samples are coalescents: `Restriction.restrict_restrict`.
  K-G (7.2).
* Transit time, entrance boundary, absorption factor: `Rates`.  K-G (5.7)-(5.13), K-C p.239.
* Ewens (3.8) normalises at `n = 2, 3`: `Mutation.ewensProb_two_total`, `.ewensProb_three_total`.

## Open, and why

**1. The split count.**  `Split` makes cuts of a class available and shows each is counted
twice by `ν ↦ (ν, λ-ν)`, which is where Kingman's factor `½ C(λ, ν)` comes from.  The
arithmetic half is proved below (`sum_choose_interior_add_two`): the cuts of a class of size
`λ` number `2^{λ-1} - 1`, and `Σ_{ν=1}^{λ-1} ½C(λ,ν)` is that number.  What is missing is
the bijection between cuts of a class and the states `ξ ≺ η` refining `η` there -- the
combinatorial half.  `JumpChain.absoluteProb_recursion` carries the factor as a written
weight until that is done.

**2. Ewens normalisation for general `n`.**  `Σ_{ξ ∈ 𝓔ₙ} θ^{|ξ|-1} ∏(λ_a - 1)! = (θ+1)⋯(θ+n-1)`.
The natural proof is the Chinese-restaurant recursion: adding an `(n+1)`-th element to a
state either starts a new class (weight `θ`) or joins a class of size `λ` (weight `λ`), so
the total gains a factor `θ + n`.  Formalising it needs the bijection
`𝓔_{n+1} ≃ Σ_{ξ ∈ 𝓔ₙ} Option (blocks of ξ)`, which the group does not have.

**3. K-C Theorem 2, the paintbox representation.**  Every exchangeable random equivalence
relation is a mixture of paintboxes.  `Paintbox` builds the paintbox and proves the
construction equivariant, which is the direction that needs no probability.  The converse is
a de Finetti theorem proved through a reversed martingale convergence argument (K-C cites
Doob VII.4.25), and nothing in this corpus is close to it.

**4. K-C Theorem 1's real content: independence.**  The factorisation `R_t = ℛ_{D_t}` with
the jump chain independent of the death process is what makes the finite-dimensional
distributions computable.  Both halves exist here separately -- the death process
arithmetically in `Rates`, the jump chain as a kernel in `Kernel` -- and their independence
does not.  It needs the continuous-time process on path space, which is not built.

**5. K-G section 6, the temporal coupling, and K-C Theorem 3, the infinite coalescent.**
Both construct processes.  The estimate that makes them possible -- `Σ_{r≥k} d_r⁻¹ = 2/(k-1)`,
so the death process enters from infinity -- IS proved
(`Rates.hasSum_one_div_deathRate_tail`); the constructions are not attempted.

None of the five is asserted anywhere in the group.  Where a result depends on one, the
dependence is a written hypothesis, not a hidden one.

## Main results

- `sum_choose_interior_add_two`: `Σ_{ν=1}^{λ-1} C(λ,ν) = 2^λ - 2`.
- `two_mul_cutCount_add_two`: so the cuts of a `λ`-class number `2^{λ-1} - 1`, which is the
  `½` in `½ C(λ, ν)` summed.

Each cut is named twice by the piece sizes -- once as `ν` and once as `λ - ν` -- which is
exactly Kingman's factor `½`, and `Split.splitBy_eq_iff` is the statement that those two

/-- **The two counts agree.**  Summing `½ C(λ, ν)` over the interior of row `λ` gives the
number of cuts of a `λ`-class.  This is the arithmetic half of open item 1: it says the
weight Kingman writes is the right weight, given that cuts and refining states correspond.
The correspondence itself is the half that is missing. -/
