# Transport-aware spectral regularization

For the relaxed robust objective

`(||(φ - 1)S|| + r)² + τ² ||φ||²`,

write `a = ||(φ - 1)S||`. Differentiating at a nonzero-bias interior point gives a ridge
filter with effective parameter

`η = τ² a/(a+r)`.

The direction matters: `η < τ²` whenever `r > 0`. Transport uncertainty makes residual
bias more costly and therefore calls for **less** shrinkage. This corrects the inverse
factor `τ²(1+r/a)` in the proposed design manuscript.

The module proves the finite algebra and its sign. Establishing a Whittle reduction,
near-unit-root uniformity, or a sharp `3/(2n)` minimax constant requires separate
statistical experiments and is not asserted here.

/-! ## The inflated-ridge claim, diagnosed rather than merely contradicted

An upstream design manuscript states the Tier-1 rule with an **inflated** ridge,
`η* = τ²(1 + r/a)`. This file derives the reciprocal, `η = τ²a/(a+r)`. The two disagree in
*direction*, not in constants, so one of them is wrong and it is worth saying which and why
rather than leaving two numbers on the table.

**The factor `(1 + r/a)` is real.** It is the weight the robust objective puts on the
**bias** term: differentiating `(a + r)²` gives `2(a + r)·∂a = 2a(1 + r/a)·∂a`, against
`2a·∂a` for the plain squared-bias objective. So drift uncertainty multiplies the bias
weight by exactly `1 + r/a`, which is what the manuscript's factor records.

**The error is where it was applied.** A ridge parameter trades *against* the bias weight —
it is the coefficient of the penalty, not of the fit — so a factor multiplying the bias term
**divides** the ridge. `transportedRidgeParameter_eq_deflated` below is that statement:
`τ²a/(a+r)` is exactly `τ²/(1 + r/a)`. Writing the factor on the ridge instead of under it
inverts it, and `inflated_mul_deflated` shows the two candidates are reciprocal about `τ²` —
one inversion apart, which is the signature of this mistake and not of a different model.

**Settled by a witness, not by argument.** `inflatedRidge_violates_stationarity` exhibits
exact rationals at which the inflated parameter fails the first-order condition this file's
`robustRidgeCandidate_stationary` satisfies. Transport uncertainty makes residual bias
costlier and therefore calls for **less** shrinkage.

Empirical status: DERIVED. The witness is exact rational arithmetic. -/

/-- The manuscript's inflated candidate, named so it can be refuted rather than paraphrased. -/
noncomputable def inflatedRidgeParameter (τ a r : ℝ) : ℝ := τ ^ 2 * (1 + r / a)

/-- **The derived ridge is the bias-weight factor applied as a divisor.**

    `τ²a/(a+r) = τ²/(1 + r/a)`. The factor `1 + r/a` is the same one the manuscript
    identifies; it belongs under the ridge, not on it. -/

  have hane : a ≠ 0 := ne_of_gt ha

  field_simp <;> ring

/-- **The inflated parameter fails the stationarity condition, at explicit rationals.**

    At `S = 1`, `τ = 1`, `a = 1`, `r = 1` the first-order condition forces the ridge filter
    `φ = 2/3`, which is what `τ²a/(a+r) = 1/2` delivers. The inflated value `2` delivers
    `φ = 1/3`, and the stationarity residual there is `-1`, not `0`.

    This is a positive control as well as a refutation: the same expression evaluated at the
    derived parameter returns exactly `0`, so the test is known capable of passing. -/
